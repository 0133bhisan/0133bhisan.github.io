	<p class="content memo"> 	
			During spring semester of my Freshmen year, I took Development Economics with Prof. Prakarsh Singh. I worked with a team comprising of  4 students throughout the semester to come up with an Experiment to be conducted in India. The experiment would create self help groups(SHGs) of women and study its "potential role on child health by analyzing the effect of combining women's empowerment and child nutrition programs."(Cited from the conculsion of the paper). Alexa Russo, one of our group members kept on working with Prof. Singh on the project after the class had ended and the final paper was published on Social Science Research Network. Below is the link to SSRN's page.
